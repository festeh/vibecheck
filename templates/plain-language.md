# Plain Language Guide

**Purpose**: Write clearly and directly using active voice, simple sentences, and minimal jargon.

**Origin**: Plain Writing Act of 2010 (US), Plain Language Movement

**Use When**: Drafting and reviewing content to maximize clarity

---

## Core Principle

**Plain language means readers understand immediately what you're saying - no rereading required.**

### Why It Matters

- **Comprehension**: 80% of readers prefer plain language (Bailey 2017)
- **Efficiency**: Plain language reduces reading time by 25-40% (Redish 1985)
- **Accessibility**: Technical audiences still prefer clarity over jargon

## The Four Rules

### 1. Use Active Voice (>80% target)

**Passive**: Subject receives action ("The error was caught by the test")
**Active**: Subject performs action ("The test caught the error")

**Why Active is Better**:
- Shorter (fewer words)
- Clearer (who does what)
- More direct (action-oriented)

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ PASSIVE:
"The bug was discovered by the QA team"
"Performance improvements were made to the API"
"A decision will be made by the committee"

✅ ACTIVE:
"The QA team discovered the bug"
"We improved API performance"
"The committee will decide"
```

**Detection Pattern**: "was/were/is/are + past participle + by"

**When Passive is Okay**:
- Unknown actor: "The system was compromised"
- Actor irrelevant: "Errors are logged automatically"
- Emphasizing recipient: "The president was elected by landslide"

### 2. Shorten Sentences (<25 words average)

**Principle**: Long sentences increase cognitive load and reduce comprehension.

**Targets**:
- **Average**: <25 words per sentence
- **Maximum**: Avoid >35 word sentences
- **Variety**: Mix short (10-15) and medium (20-25) sentences

**Techniques**:
```markdown
❌ LONG (42 words):
"After extensive research and consideration of multiple
frameworks over several months using various criteria
including performance, ecosystem size, learning curve,
and community support, we determined that React offers
the best balance for our team's needs."

✅ SPLIT (2 sentences, 23 + 14 words):
"Our evaluation of 5 frameworks over 3 months ranked
React highest across 12 criteria, including performance,
ecosystem, and learning curve. React offers the best
balance for our team's needs."
```

**How to Shorten**:
1. Split at "and", "but", "because"
2. Remove redundancy
3. Break into bullets if listing >3 items
4. Move subordinate clauses to new sentence

### 3. Eliminate Jargon (or Explain on First Use)

**Jargon**: Specialized terminology that excludes readers.

**When to Use Jargon**:
- ✅ Technical audience expects it (API docs for developers)
- ✅ No simpler alternative exists (monadic bind operation)
- ✅ Explained on first use with example

**When to Avoid**:
- ❌ Simpler word exists: "utilize" → "use"
- ❌ Buzzword adds no meaning: "leverage synergistic paradigms"
- ❌ Abbreviation unexplained: "RBAC" (first use: Role-Based Access Control)

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ JARGON HEAVY:
"Leverage microservices to achieve scalable, cloud-native
architecture with seamless integration paradigms"

✅ PLAIN:
"Break your application into small, independent services
that can scale individually and run in the cloud"

✅ JARGON EXPLAINED:
"Use microservices—small, independent services that handle
specific functions—to scale your application efficiently"
```

### 4. Write Clearly (Avoid Common Issues)

**Nominalization** (verb → noun weakens writing):
```markdown
❌ make a decision → ✅ decide
❌ perform an analysis → ✅ analyze
❌ give consideration to → ✅ consider
❌ have a discussion about → ✅ discuss
```

**Weak Verbs** (vague actions):
```markdown
❌ utilize → ✅ use
❌ facilitate → ✅ enable / allow
❌ implement → ✅ build / create
❌ leverage → ✅ use / apply
```

**Redundancy** (unnecessary words):
```markdown
❌ advance planning → ✅ planning
❌ past history → ✅ history
❌ completely eliminate → ✅ eliminate
❌ end result → ✅ result
```

**Weasel Words** (often removable):
```markdown
❌ very important → ✅ critical / important
❌ really significant → ✅ significant
❌ actually improves → ✅ improves
❌ basically works → ✅ works
```

## Measurement

### Active Voice Percentage

**Targets**:
- 90-100%: Excellent (Tutorial)
- 80-89%: Good (How-To, Explanation)
- 70-79%: Acceptable (Reference)
- <70%: Needs improvement

### Sentence Length

**Targets**:
- <20 words: Excellent clarity
- 20-25 words: Good balance
- 25-30 words: Acceptable but monitor
- >30 words: Consider splitting
